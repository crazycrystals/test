<h1> Batch </h1>
<h3> The basics </h3>
<p> Lets hope you know command prompt at least some, if not you will have fun messing with it. Trust me. </p>
<br>
<p> Now that you have hopefully messed with the terminal some, I am going to go ahead and explain everything anyways.</p>
<h6> Because I know you did not, Lyar.</h6>
<br>
<h4> Hello World </h4>
<p> So do you know how to make a file with the extension .bat? no? ok. </p>
<p> 1. Open Notepad or notepad++,  <! IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SET IT TO .BAT YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF OTHER EDITORS. !> </p>
<! With that little freakout over, I can continue on, User. !>
<p> 2. Hit CTRL+S </p>
<p> 3. Hit "Text Documents (*.txt) </p>
<p> 4. Hit "All Files (*.*)" </p>
<p> 5. Name it whatever you want, but with .bat at the end. </p>
<br>
<p> Now that you have a batch file, lets write in it. </p>
<p> Do the Following Lines </p>
<br>
<p> echo off -- This is telling the computer to not show commands to user, user will think it haxxing if not done. </p>
<p> cls -- This is telling the computer to get rid of the echo off command that was showing on the command prompt window </p>
<p> echo Hello World -- This is telling the computer to put the words "Hello World" into the terminal. </p>
<p> pause -- This is telling the computer to pause the command prompt until user inputs any key, it is so they can see the "Hello World". In a case that the script is just doing a quick thing though, you do not want to have this line. </p>
