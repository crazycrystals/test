<! Hello, I am making my first site not hosted on whatever cringe the school uses. I am also letting you use it for whatever
you want assuming you wanted the dumb thing for some reason. !>

<h1> Hello, heres a site I made with to much freetime, and probably not doing homework. </h1>
<h2> Why would I make it? "Its not about why, but why not" - Aperture Labs </h2>
<br>

<h3> What this site is actually for </h3>
<p> This site is for me practicing html more so that I do not end up forgetting it like I did java or python, because thats not fun, while remembering it is.  </p>
<p> It will also help me learn how to use github and set up my own site. </p>
<!-- <p> I also have my own domain, which is crazycrystals.tk, I currently just have it go to never gonna give you up though. </p> --> <! Commented out because I just as I am typing this set it up to where crazycrystals.tk redirects to crazycrystals.github.io, !>
<! For anybody looking at code, you might want to turn on word wrap. !>
<! I promise I will not be a google and I will make sure to space out lines of code. !>
<! Enough procrastinating, now I will actually do coding. !>
